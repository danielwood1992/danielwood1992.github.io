  <h1>Find a solution to the ash killing parrot.</h1>
  <p>The year is 2054. Having finally restored EAB and ADB resistant ash to the landscape...the ash killing parrot arrived.</p>
  <p>You are a researcher starting with £1,000,000. You can perform various actions/experiments to try and investigate the phenomenon</p>
  <p>Can you find a solution before all the ash is dead (again)?</p>
  <p>Note - this is currently a demo where I'm trying to figure out how to make the buttons/pictures/money system etc. work</p>
  <p>Once I've got a hang of the basics (not done this before) it should be fairly easy to add a lot more actual scientific content</p>
